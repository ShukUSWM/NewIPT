# Flask MySQL API with XML and JSON Support

This Flask application provides a RESTful API to interact with a MySQL database. It supports basic authentication and can return responses in both JSON and XML formats. The application includes endpoints to manage customer data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- MySQL server or MySQL Workbench
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up MySQL database:

Ensure your MySQL server is running.
Create the database and necessary tables. The configuration in this application assumes a database named "mung_beans_final".

### Additional Notes

1. **Database Schema:** Ensure your MySQL database schema matches the queries used in the code.
2. **Error Handling:** The current implementation has basic error handling. You may want to enhance it as needed.
3. **Dependencies:** Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if it doesn't already exist.

To generate the `requirements.txt` file, you can use:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
